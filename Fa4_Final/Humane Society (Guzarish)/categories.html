              <p>
     For many people food has been a luxury more than mere necessity. While people enjoy home cooked hot meals 
	 there are children and women struggling for a bite of food while picking up the rag. NGO's collect all the 
	 extra leftover foods donated by generous people and feed the needy with the life's most basic requirement.

              <p>
When the sunsets and the night draw near, a single light from the lamppost 20 meters away becomes
the only source of light for so many street dwellers. A half-torn blanket, a shredded asbestos ceiling, 
and an earthen stove are all the properties of those people. They are deprived of the basic amenities in life. 
They do not have proper beds, drinking water, and even toilet.

Childhood is the most innocent phase of any individual. Every child deserves healthy and normal childhood. 
But for many children, the reality of childhood is altogether different as they are employed as labour and
their childhood is disturbed.

We all have clothes lying around the house that arenâ€™t being used anymore and could very well be given away to those who might have better use for them. So rather than wasting a piece of cloth which was made by a lot of efforts by our workers, why not we give it to someone who needs a cloth to cover his body.
